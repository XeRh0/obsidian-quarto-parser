This is the last callout test (for now).
I am leaving some text here up front, to check the behaviour

[!callout] this is an incorrect callout

Lets try to give one a name and set the collapse setting.

> [!robbie]- A callout with a name
> This is Robbie, our first named callout.
> He has collapse set to true.

Now we should check out nested callouts.
Let us go for a callout, with two nested callouts.

> [!parent] The parent
> This is a parent callout.
> It contains two children.
> > [!child] The first child
> > This is Bobby - he is a great friend with Robbie.
> > He loves tomatoes.
>
> > [!child] The second child
> > This is Toby.
> > Toby is a hater.
> > Toby calls Bobby and Robbie slurs.
> > Don't be like Toby, let people live how they want.
>
> This is the end of the parent.

This is the end of the whole test.
Hope it went well!
