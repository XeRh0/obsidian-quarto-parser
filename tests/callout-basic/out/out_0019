This is the last callout test (for now).
I am leaving some text here up front, to check the behaviour

[!callout] this is an incorrect callout

Lets try to give one a name and set the collapse setting.


::: {.robbie title="A callout with a name" collapse=true}
This is Robbie, our first named callout.
He has collapse set to true.
:::

Now we should check out nested callouts.
Let us go for a callout, with two nested callouts.


::: {.parent title="The parent"}
This is a parent callout.
It contains two children.

::: {.child title="The first child"}
This is Bobby - he is a great friend with Robbie.
He loves tomatoes.
:::


::: {.child title="The second child"}
This is Toby.
Toby is a hater.
Toby calls Bobby and Robbie slurs.
Don't be like Toby, let people live how they want.
:::

This is the end of the parent.
:::

This is the end of the whole test.
Hope it went well!
