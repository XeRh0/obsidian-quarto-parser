# obsidian-quarto-parser

This is a personal script for parsing specific parts of the obsidian markdown syntax into quarto.

# TODO

High priority:
- [ ] Add more verbatim tests

- [ ] Add a flag for verbatim parsing (currently it does so by default, but it should not)
- [ ] Clean up available i/o options - currently too many redundant options
- [ ] Proper comments
- [ ] YAML header parsing support
